```


## Acceptance Criteria

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

I notice that the CSS had all the ID and Classes. This lead me start creating a button (that was the simle one).
I then added a textarea for teeh users input. I also added two div`s for the time. After seening one section I copied and pasted the 
other sections. I aldo added a section for the text to display afetr clicking twice on save to display.
